## Installation

1. i created a repository to store and add my created files.
2. After the repo was created i created the base files and pushed them to the repo.
3. When the base files were added i begain to code my html and css docs and javascript.
4. To start i made sure that in the html i linked all my files and added all my tags that i will target via css or js
5. Each tag got a class or id that can me called on.
6. Once those were added i began to style the page.
7. I added the an image to the header, i made it fit the page, and changed the font and color for every element inside the body tag.
8. Next i put everything inside of my main tag in a flex box so can justify and align it to the center of the page and gave it a box and shadow.
9. After the box was created i styled buttons and the question screens/cards.
10. When everything is styled i began working on the js by creating consts that target different id's with querySelector.
11. I targetted those consts and added event listeners that activate a function on a click of the const
12. After this i created global variables to target throughout my js
13. Now i will begin creating the functions so i started with hiding the cards.
14. Next i added a function to not display the results untill called.
15. Now i create the functions that make the page work which are: to start the quiz on click, display the question, store the score/save the score you got at the end, to update the highscores at the very end, the speed in which the page will count down, display the time in the chosen area, checking if the answer is right or wrong and if wrong remove some time and to cycle through questions array, to end the quiz/ stop showing certain screens/cards, to occupy/fill the leaderboard with user input, to update the leaderboard changing the input into a string, will sort the score best to worse, will allow you to go to the beginning of the quiz when the button is clicked, will clear the highscores list when the clear button is clicked, and this final function will allow you to view the highscores list at anytime during the quiz so long as there are names listed.

## Usage 
- To begin/take the assignment click the begin button and answer all the questions.

- When finished you will be asked to publish your score on the leaderboard

- When your name is published you will be taken to the leaderboard and have the option to clear the leaderboard or go back to the start of the quiz.
